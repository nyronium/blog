# Why do I need to add a GitHub account to Nytro?
Nytro works, by using the GitHub API to fetch information about a project. The search function also uses this API to gain information. Therefore, Nytro has to send a lot of requests to this API, but your requests are limited to 60 free requests per hour. But if you authenticate with the API, you'll have 5000 requests per hour and access to account specific API sections.
